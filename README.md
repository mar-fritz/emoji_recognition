In this project we implement a facial and gesture recognition program, leveraging the open-source framework MediaPipe.
We create a pipeline for the recognition of facial expressions and gestures in real time through the computer webcam, matching them to a selection of emojis.

The project was created as an assignment for the course "Practical Machine Learning" of the MSc Big Data and Analytics at the University of Piraeus taught by professor Ilias Maglogiannis.
The full report can be found in the [Report.pdf](Report.pdf) file of this repo.
